# Yet another update

Due to an issue with the GitHub account that I used to create and host this webpage, I had to do much more work to get the update post working yesterday.

So far, it **LOOKS** like it's working, however that is with no actual redirection from the domain, just using the direct display method of access.

Hopefully, the GitHub team will be able to get back to me sometime in the next 48 hours with a way to fix the problem. However, I do have this way of updating things if worse comes to worse.  
  
Once things get fixed, I will hopefully be able to start keeping up with things.

Until next time, be safe.

Greg
