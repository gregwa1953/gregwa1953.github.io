# Yet again another update...

As I said in my last post, I'm trying to update this site to a more "modern" look and feel. Fortunately, things have finally started falling my way.

As of this morning, it looks like the site is firmly linked through my thedesignatedgeek.xyz domain to the new GitHub repository.

I've been having major issues trying to get the files for the site to properly sync with GitHub repository, but at this moment it seems to be working properly. Of course, this could change as I'm trying to get things synced.

Hopefully, I will be able to start looking for a different Jekyll template (theme) that will still work with what I've already set up this weekend. Seven years is a long time, so I'm not sure. I might have to try to transition to a different static site generator.

Stay tuned!!!


Until next time, be safe.
