<p>I’ve written about Page a number of times over the years (since 2012 actually), and I love it. Page is a Drag-and-drop GUI (Grapical User Interface) designer for Python using Tkinter that is written by Don Rozenberg. Page creates Python files Page has been around many years and is currently at version 4.13. It features Graphical menus, notebook widgets and panedwindow widgets. It supports most Tk and many ttk widgets and is very easy to use. Don has written a large number of examples and some very good documentation for Page.</p>

			<h2>About Me</h2></header><a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="assets/images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>My name is Greg Walters and I have been a programmer since 1972.  I am currently retired and living
    in Central Texas, USA.  I currently write (somewhat due to medical problems) monthly articles for <br>
    <a href="https://fullcirclemagazine.org">Full Circle Magazine</a>
    and have since issue #27 back in July 2009. <br> 
    My latest article can be found in issue #133 (May 2018). <br><br>
    I am also an author, amature photographer, fair musician and a pretty darn good cook.<br>
    I ocassionally do custom tutorials for various people and projects, the latest of which <br>
    is for <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/page/">Page</a> which is a free GUI designer for Python. <br>
    My tutorial can be found in the /docs folder of the latest Page release. <br><br>
    I am currently writing a book on using Page which will hopefully be published in <br>
    late 2018 or 2019. At this point, I'm planning on it having between 10 and 15 chapters<br>
    and being about 450 pages long.
